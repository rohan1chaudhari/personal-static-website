<h2 id="day-1-the-foundation-feb-16-1624">Day 1: The Foundation (Feb 16, 16:24)</h2>
<p>It started with a simple idea: I wanted a single place to run small personal apps without spinning up a new VPS for every little tool. At 4:24 PM, I initialized the monorepo skeleton. By 4:28, I&rsquo;d already made the key architectural decision that would define everything after: <strong>each app gets its own SQLite database</strong>, completely isolated from the others. No shared schemas, no cross-app queries. If I delete an app, I delete one file. Simple.</p>
<p>The host came together quickly—a Next.js app that would serve as both the control plane and the runtime. I sketched out the first two apps that same afternoon: <strong>Smart Notes</strong> for capturing thoughts, and <strong>Gym Tracker</strong> for logging workouts. Both followed the same pattern: a minimal UI, a simple API, and their own <code>db.sqlite</code> file tucked away in <code>data/apps/&lt;appId&gt;/</code>.</p>
<p>By 5 PM, I had working prototypes. By 6 PM, they looked decent—Tailwind CSS tied it all together. But &ldquo;decent&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t enough. I kept going.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-1-evening-smart-notes-gets-real">Day 1 Evening: Smart Notes Gets Real</h2>
<p>The first version of Smart Notes was just a list and a form. Useful, but boring. I wanted something I&rsquo;d actually enjoy using.</p>
<p>At 5:24 PM, I added a proper note detail page. Then soft deletes (5:33 PM)—because accidents happen. Then a trash view with restore and purge (5:36 PM). Search highlighting (5:36 PM). Pinning (6:26 PM). Each commit was small, but the cumulative effect was a notes app that felt <em>alive</em>.</p>
<p>The big leap came at 5:51 PM: <strong>voice notes</strong>. I added a record button that captures audio on mobile, pipes it through ElevenLabs Scribe for transcription, and structures it into markdown. By 6:04 PM, I&rsquo;d tuned it to use the best models and keep the output faithful—no over-enthusiastic &ldquo;meeting notes&rdquo; rewrites, just clean structured text.</p>
<p>Autosave landed at 6:23 PM, followed by undo-delete snackbars. By the end of the evening, Smart Notes wasn&rsquo;t a toy anymore. It was the notes app I&rsquo;d been looking for.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-2-gym-tracker-finds-its-flow">Day 2: Gym Tracker Finds Its Flow</h2>
<p>Feb 16, 11:25 PM. I turned to Gym Tracker with fresh eyes. The initial &ldquo;log a workout&rdquo; flow was clunky. I reimagined it as a <strong>guided session logger</strong>: you pick a day category (Push, Pull, Legs, etc.), then log sets one by one with voice-to-fill support.</p>
<p>Voice-to-fill is one of those features that sounds gimmicky until you try it. At 10:19 AM on Feb 17, I added it: tap the mic, say &ldquo;bench press 185 for 8 reps, set 3,&rdquo; and it extracts the fields automatically. No form tapping. It just works.</p>
<p>Then came the analytics (Feb 17, 12:12 AM). Heatmaps showing workout consistency. Weekly stacked bars. Line charts tracking exercise progression over time. I found myself opening the app just to look at my data.</p>
<p>The UI got the same treatment as Smart Notes—mobile-first, sticky navigation, app-like feel. By noon on Feb 17, Gym Tracker felt like a native app running in my browser.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-paper-notebook-detour-feb-17-121-pm">The Paper Notebook Detour (Feb 17, 1:21 PM)</h2>
<p>Sometimes you chase an idea that doesn&rsquo;t pan out. I got obsessed with making Smart Notes look like a physical paper notebook—textures, handwritten fonts, ruled lines. I committed the changes: textures, Patrick Hand font, full analog redesign.</p>
<p>Then I used it for 10 minutes and hated it. Legibility suffered. The novelty wore off fast. At 1:49 PM, I reverted all seven commits. The app went back to clean, readable, digital-native UI. No regrets—you don&rsquo;t know until you try.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-3-tags-mobile-polish-and-the-scrum-board-feb-18">Day 3: Tags, Mobile Polish, and the Scrum Board (Feb 18)</h2>
<p>Feb 18 started with practical improvements. Tags for Smart Notes (12:43 AM)—with automatic GPS and timestamp tagging. A floating action button for mobile (12:46 AM). Pinch-zoom disabled so it feels like an app, not a website (1:08 AM).</p>
<p>Then I stripped the UI down: removed the home nav, the brand headers, the taglines. Clean surfaces. Focus on content.</p>
<p>The afternoon brought something bigger: <strong>Scrum Board</strong>. I needed a way to track tasks across all these apps. By 1:44 PM, I had per-app boards with priorities. Assignees by 1:45 PM. Due dates by 2:02 PM. Manual ordering by 2:06 PM. Modal task editors by 12:49 PM.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t want to <em>manually</em> move cards. I wanted an autopilot.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-4-the-autopilot-awakens-feb-18-20">Day 4: The Autopilot Awakens (Feb 18-20)</h2>
<p>Feb 18, 3:27 PM. I wrote the AUTOPILOT runbook—a cron-driven system where an AI agent picks up tasks, implements them, and reports back. By 3:47 PM, the Scrum Board was upgraded with autopilot states: <code>pending</code> → <code>in_progress</code> → <code>awaiting_review</code> → <code>done</code>.</p>
<p>The integration was surprisingly clean. The Scrum Board got an &ldquo;Agent Trigger&rdquo; button (7:43 PM). Cron jobs handled scheduling. Each autopilot run:</p>
<ol>
<li>Picks a todo task</li>
<li>Spawns an isolated session</li>
<li>Implements the feature</li>
<li>Commits with <code>autopilot(&lt;app&gt;): &lt;description&gt;</code></li>
<li>Reports back to the task</li>
</ol>
<p>By Feb 19, the autopilot was handling real work: upgrading Smart Notes with a Tiptap editor, fixing mobile modals, adding app images to the home page. Each commit in the log after Feb 19 7:20 PM is autopilot work—tagged, traced, reviewable.</p>
<p>The system even blocked itself when I forgot to add acceptance criteria (Feb 20, 12:22 AM). Good guardrails.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-i-built">What I Built</h2>
<p>Four days. 80+ commits. Three working apps and a meta-layer that manages them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Notes</strong> — Voice-to-markdown notes with tags, search, trash, and a proper rich editor</li>
<li><strong>Gym Tracker</strong> — Session-based workout logging with voice input and analytics dashboards</li>
<li><strong>Scrum Board</strong> — Kanban boards with autopilot integration for AI-driven development</li>
<li><strong>Citadel (host)</strong> — Permission system, per-app SQLite isolation, audit logging, app registry</li>
</ul>
<p>The architecture held up. Per-app databases mean I can nuke Gym Tracker without touching my notes. The deny-by-default permission model means apps can&rsquo;t wander. The autopilot means I can spec a feature and come back to a pull request.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-id-do-differently">What I&rsquo;d Do Differently</h2>
<p>The paper notebook detour taught me to test UI changes faster. I should&rsquo;ve prototyped in the browser before committing seven reverts.</p>
<p>The autopilot needed clearer acceptance criteria from the start. It&rsquo;s good that it blocks on vague tasks, but I should&rsquo;ve documented the format earlier.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-stack">The Stack</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong>: SQLite (one per app), accessed via <code>node:sqlite</code></li>
<li><strong>Styling</strong>: Tailwind CSS v3</li>
<li><strong>AI</strong>: ElevenLabs Scribe (STT), various LLMs for structuring and autopilot</li>
<li><strong>Orchestration</strong>: OpenClaw cron jobs for autopilot scheduling</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next</h2>
<p>The autopilot is still learning. I&rsquo;m refining the prompt engineering, adding more guardrails, and building out the review flow. The next apps are already specced: a finance tracker, a reading list, maybe a personal CRM.</p>
<p>Citadel started as a way to avoid spinning up new VPS instances. It became something more interesting: a platform where I can <em>think</em> in apps, build them quickly, and let an agent handle the grunt work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the story so far. The commits tell the rest.</p>
